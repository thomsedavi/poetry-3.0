# poetry-3.0
I have an idea for some poetry I want to write. It involves taking found sentence fragments and putting them in the context of my own writing. I want to see the sentence fragments on their own so I'm not influenced on other fragments. I want to either save drafts of each paragraph, or mark it as final. When all paragraphs are final I want to be able to order them, and add new sentences when needed.
I don't think this will be much use to anyone but me. But play with it if you want.
